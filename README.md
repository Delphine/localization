Mozilla's translation and localization (l10n) efforts spread Firefox and the web throughout the world.

Localization refers to the adaptation of a product, application or document content to meet the language, cultural and other requirements of a specific target market (a locale). 

Localization is sometimes written as **l10n**, where 10 is the number of letters between l and n.
